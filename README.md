# 🔊 Text-to-Speech API

## 📜 Overview

The **Text-to-Speech API** is a web-based application that converts written text into natural-sounding speech. It leverages the built-in **Web Speech API** to generate audio output, enabling users to interact with text-based content through voice.

### 🌍 **Why Use a Text-to-Speech System?**
With the growing demand for accessibility and audio-based content, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology plays a crucial role in various domains, including:
- **Accessibility**: Helps visually impaired individuals by reading out text.
- **Education**: Enhances learning experiences with auditory content.
- **Entertainment**: Converts stories, articles, or messages into voice.
- **Productivity**: Assists in proofreading by reading text aloud.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**
1. **User Input**: The user enters text into a designated text box.
2. **Speech Synthesis**: The browser's **Web Speech API** processes the input and converts it into speech.
3. **Playback Controls**: Users can start, stop, or adjust the speech output.

### 🛠 **Technology Used**
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and user interface design.
- **JavaScript**: To handle text-to-speech functionality via the **Web Speech API**.

## 🚀 **Installation & Setup**
### 🔹 Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a modern web browser like **Chrome, Edge, or Firefox** that supports the Web Speech API. Open index.html in a Browser
2. Simply double-click index.html or open it using a local server:
**python -m http.server 8000**
3. Then, visit http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

📜 File Descriptions
🔹 index.html
This file contains the structure of the web page, including the text input field and a button to trigger the speech synthesis.

🔹 style.css
Defines the layout and design of the webpage, making it visually appealing.

🔹 script.js
Handles the core logic for text-to-speech conversion using the Web Speech API.

🎤 How It Works
1. User enters text in the input box.
2. The "Speak" button triggers the Web Speech API.
3. The API converts the text into speech and plays it.
4. Users can stop or change the speech settings (if available).
