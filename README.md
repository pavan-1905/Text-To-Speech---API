# Text To Speech - API
# 🔊 Text-to-Speech API

## 📜 Overview

The **Text-to-Speech API** is a web-based application that converts written text into natural-sounding speech. It leverages the built-in **Web Speech API** to generate audio output, enabling users to interact with text-based content through voice.

### 🌍 **Why Use a Text-to-Speech System?**
With the growing demand for accessibility and audio-based content, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology plays a crucial role in various domains, including:
- **Accessibility**: Helps visually impaired individuals by reading out text.
- **Education**: Enhances learning experiences with auditory content.
- **Entertainment**: Converts stories, articles, or messages into voice.
- **Productivity**: Assists in proofreading by reading text aloud.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**
1. **User Input**: The user enters text into a designated text box.
2. **Speech Synthesis**: The browser's **Web Speech API** processes the input and converts it into speech.
3. **Playback Controls**: Users can start, stop, or adjust the speech output.

### 🛠 **Technology Used**
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and user interface design.
- **JavaScript**: To handle text-to-speech functionality via the **Web Speech API**.
